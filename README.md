Attached in the SQL tabs are some examples of work i completed for a music company that helped them identify customers and invoices to increase their production. 
In the Alteryx tab it incudes a snapshot of an automation i created that helped a stakeholder automate a report that the stakeholder previously had to manually find and document daily, that took up about 20 hours of their time each week. This report is now automated with an update daily and a report being emailed out to the stakeholder.
In the Dual Access, Tableau and Simplify2 tab are some snapshots of examples i created for a powerpoint for UHC to show how to make the data reportings more clear, simpler, and easy to read at first glance.
